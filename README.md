The provided code defines a Python module that includes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) class designed to process data through different stages: bronze, silver, and gold. The module begins by importing necessary components from the pyspark.sql package, including DataFrame, SparkSession, StructType, and functions like when and col. It then initializes a Spark session named "MyApp".

The ETL class contains three class methods: bronze, silver, and gold. Each method represents a different stage in the ETL process.

The bronze method takes a Spark session, a schema, and a list of data as input. It creates a DataFrame from the provided data and schema, then filters out rows where the 'customer_id' column is null. This method ensures that only valid customer data is processed further.

The silver method takes a DataFrame as input and adjusts the 'order_amount' column based on the 'status' column. If the 'status' is 'pending', the 'order_amount' is multiplied by 1.3. Otherwise, the 'order_amount' remains unchanged. This transformation helps in adjusting the order amounts based on their status.

The gold method aggregates the input DataFrame by summing the order amounts for each customer. It groups the data by the 'customer_id' column and calculates the total order amount for each customer. This method provides a summary of the total spending of each customer.

Overall, the ETL class provides a structured way to process and transform data through different stages, ensuring data quality and consistency.
