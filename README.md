# ETL Module
The provided code defines a Python module that includes an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) class designed to process data through different stages: bronze, silver, and gold. The module begins by importing necessary components from the `pyspark.sql` package, including `DataFrame`, `SparkSession`, `StructType`, and functions like `when` and `col`. It then initializes a Spark session named "MyApp".

The `ETL` class contains three class methods: `bronze`, `silver`, and `gold`. Each method represents a different stage in the ETL process.

The `bronze` method takes a Spark session, a schema, and a list of data as input. It creates a DataFrame from the provided data and schema, then filters out rows where the 'customer_id' column is null. This method ensures that only valid customer data is processed further.

The `silver` method takes a DataFrame as input and adjusts the 'order_amount' column based on the 'status' column. If the 'status' is 'pending', the 'order_amount' is multiplied by 1.3. Otherwise, the 'order_amount' remains unchanged. This transformation helps in adjusting the order amounts based on their status.

The `gold` method aggregates the input DataFrame by summing the order amounts for each customer. It groups the data by the 'customer_id' column and calculates the total order amount for each customer. This method provides a summary of the total spending of each customer.

Overall, the `ETL` class provides a structured way to process and transform data through different stages, ensuring data quality and consistency.

## Unit Test Case 

Test suite for the ETL process using PySpark and pytest.

This test suite includes the following tests:
1. test_field_count: Verifies that the input DataFrame has the expected number of fields.
2. test_bronze: Tests the ETL.bronze function to ensure it processes the input data correctly.
3. test_silver: Tests the silver transformation of the ETL process to verify correct aggregation of order amounts.
4. test_gold: Tests the entire ETL pipeline from bronze to gold dataframes and verifies the final output.


Tests:
- test_field_count(spark: SparkSession) -> None: Asserts that the number of fields in the DataFrame schema is equal to 5.
- test_bronze(spark: SparkSession) -> None: Asserts that the resulting DataFrame from ETL.bronze has 9 rows.
- test_silver(spark: SparkSession) -> None: Asserts that the total order amount in the silver DataFrame matches the expected value.
- test_gold(spark: SparkSession) -> None: Asserts that the gold DataFrame contains exactly 4 rows and the total order amount matches the expected value.

test_field_count

Description: Verifies that the input DataFrame has the expected number of fields.

Logic:

Create a DataFrame using the sample data and schema.
Count the number of fields in the DataFrame schema.
Assert that the number of fields is equal to 5.

Here is the detailed test case specification including the logic for each test:

### Test Suite for the ETL Process

This test suite uses PySpark and pytest to validate the ETL process. It includes the following tests:

#### Tests

1. **test_field_count**

   **Description**: Verifies that the input DataFrame has the expected number of fields.

   **Logic**:
   - Create a DataFrame using the sample data and schema.
   - Count the number of fields in the DataFrame schema.
   - Assert that the number of fields is equal to 5.


2. **test_bronze**

   **Description**: Tests the `ETL.bronze` function to ensure it processes the input data correctly.

   **Logic**:
   - Create a DataFrame using the `ETL.bronze` method.
   - Assert that the resulting DataFrame has 9 rows (filters out rows where 'customer_id' is null).


3. **test_silver**

   **Description**: Tests the silver transformation of the ETL process to verify correct aggregation of order amounts.

   **Logic**:
   - Create a bronze DataFrame using the `ETL.bronze` method.
   - Transform the bronze DataFrame to a silver DataFrame using the `ETL.silver` method.
   - Aggregate the total order amount from the silver DataFrame.
   - Assert that the total order amount matches the expected value.


4. **test_gold**

   **Description**: Tests the entire ETL pipeline from bronze to gold DataFrames and verifies the final output.

   **Logic**:
   - Create a bronze DataFrame using the `ETL.bronze` method.
   - Transform the bronze DataFrame to a silver DataFrame using the `ETL.silver` method.
   - Transform the silver DataFrame to a gold DataFrame using the `ETL.gold` method.
   - Assert that the gold DataFrame contains exactly 4 rows.
   - Aggregate the total order amount from the gold DataFrame.
   - Assert that the total order amount matches the expected value.


This detailed test case specification ensures that each stage of the ETL process is thoroughly tested, verifying the correctness of the transformations and aggregations performed by the `ETL` class methods.
